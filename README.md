#GIF Safe, GIFsafe.com
This application is built off of Ruby on Rails that functions as a GIF library web application to enable users to access their favorite GIFs through their own personal Safe, no matter what the device!

The application uses Devise for user authentication, Simple_forms to quickly generate forms, Bootstrap for a stylish front-end framework, and Postgresql as the primary database.

This application is accessible through http://www.GIFSafe.com
